# Sample Machine Learning Notes

## Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

### Types of Machine Learning

1. **Supervised Learning**
   - Uses labeled training data
   - Examples: Classification, Regression
   - Algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks

2. **Unsupervised Learning**
   - Works with unlabeled data
   - Examples: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction
   - Algorithms: K-Means, PCA, Autoencoders

3. **Reinforcement Learning**
   - Learns through trial and error
   - Agent interacts with environment
   - Examples: Game playing, Robotics

## Key Concepts

### Neural Networks
- Inspired by biological neural networks
- Consists of layers: input, hidden, output
- Uses activation functions: ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh

### Training Process
1. Initialize weights randomly
2. Forward propagation
3. Calculate loss
4. Backpropagation
5. Update weights
6. Repeat until convergence

### Common Algorithms

**Linear Regression**: y = mx + b
- Simple yet powerful
- Used for prediction
- Minimizes mean squared error

**Decision Trees**
- Tree-like model of decisions
- Easy to interpret
- Can overfit without pruning

**Random Forest**
- Ensemble of decision trees
- Reduces overfitting
- High accuracy

## Applications

- Image Recognition
- Natural Language Processing
- Recommendation Systems
- Autonomous Vehicles
- Healthcare Diagnosis

## Best Practices

1. Start with simple models
2. Use cross-validation
3. Handle missing data properly
4. Feature engineering is crucial
5. Monitor for overfitting
6. Use appropriate metrics

## Conclusion

Machine Learning is transforming industries and creating new possibilities. Understanding these fundamentals is essential for building effective ML systems.
